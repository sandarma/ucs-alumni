            <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>
            On February 1st 2021, a military coup violently took over the democratically
            elected government of Myanmar, detained all of its leaders and denied the voices
            of over 40 million Myanmar people. In just 3 months, over <span style={{color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>750 people have been
            killed</span> including peaceful protestors and dozens of children, and over 3000 people
            have been arbitrarily detained and charged with crimes they did not commit.
            Myanmar is on the brink of a failed state, economy is in a freefall, and civil wars
            have broken out all throughout the country.

            <h3>What CDM is:</h3>
            <p>Civilian workers including healthcare professionals, teachers, engineers, railway
            workers and civil servants of all various sectors have been participating in a
            nationwide labour strike by the name of <b>Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)</b>.
            These workers have been hanging by a thread without any type of income since the
            coup took place and bravely refused to return to work in a defiance against the
            regime even though their lives have been threatened. Families have been evicted
            from their homes for participating in CDM, and many have lost their loved ones
            who were bread winners.</p>

            <h3>Why support:</h3>
            <p>Not knowing how much longer this fight will take but <b>Civil Disobedience
            Movement</b> participants are absolutely relentless in their fight for democracy and
            justice. People are impacted by the mounting financial burden of not being able to
            earn wages from working. Their bravery and sacrifice are praised globally and
            have recently been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for next year. There is
            incredible strength of the solidarity of the Myanmar people and we urge all our
            citizens worldwide to join us in this historic fight. We ask for your much-needed
            support to assist these courageous people of Myanmar participating in CDM in an
            <b>effort to restore democracy</b>.</p>
